Case Study on Branch
# Branch: A Minnesota FinTech company that empowers working Americans.

[Branch](https://www.branchapp.com/about) is a FinTech company located in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The company leverages mobile technology and partnerships with some of the leading [American payroll and workforce technologies](https://www.branchapp.com/partners) to deliver digital payroll/ paycheck services to employers and workers.  By offering instant access to earned wages, zero fee bank accounts, and free budget management advising, Branch is a game changer for American companies and hourly wage earners.

Branch was founded in 2015 by [Atif Siddiqi](https://www.branchapp.com/team/atif-siddiqi). Mr. Siddiqi earned a Bachelor's degree in Economics from the University of Southern California (USC) in 2005 and a Master of Business Administration from the [USC Marshall School of Business](https://www.marshall.usc.edu/) in 2013. Siddiq's ideas for using mobile apps and digital payment technologies began when he was a student working for a business named "The T-shirt Shack". Siddiq and his coworkers used mobile phones to organize shift swaps. 

>"...the idea behind Branch was really how do we help hourly employees grow financially? We landed on a use case of helping them earn additional income by picking up available shifts at their employer." (1)

Recalling how mobile communications saved T-shirt Shack workers the time it took to travel to work and read the handwritten work schedule, Siddiqi developed a simple messaging app for the purpose. 

The idea for Branch really coalesced during his time as an _entrepreneur in residence_ at the Pasedena technology incubator, [Idealab](https://www.idealab.com/).

>"...we just kept on packing what's the real problem our end users are facing and that's when we discoverd sort of a slew of financial challenges they were facing" (1)

Siddiqi realized that by accessing a company's official employee time and attendance records along with their hourly wage, he could calculate exact earnings and deliver up to 50% of a worker's wages ahead of the pay cycle. Importantly, he realized that he could do this without tacking on fees. Additionally, Siddiqi constructed digital wallets that are linked to a debit card.

Development of applications that ease hourly worker compensation and financial stability continues to be Branch's major goal. Siddiqi's ideas for the future include applications in the restaurant industry such as digital tipping and reimbursment of delivery drivers. The ability of companies to embed Branch's offerings into their own solutions or apps is also a strong selling point that will keep Branch in a lead position. This ability has been proven out in a [partnership with Domino's pizza](https://www.branchapp.com/blog/dominos-same-day-tips-mileage).

## Funding

Branch has recieved a total of $633.1 million in funding in a total of five funding rounds(2). Seed funding for the company occured on June 20, 2016 and ammounted to $120,000. Seed funding was provided by five investors including [Techstars](https://www.techstars.com/), [Right Side Capital Management](http://rightsidecapital.com/), and [Matchstick Ventures](https://www.matchstick.vc/). Series A funding occured on August 2, 2017 for the ammount of $10 million. Funders again included Techstars and Matchstick Ventures along with six other venture capital investors. On August 17, 2021, Branch recieved $500 million in debt financing from the Neuberger Berman Group and Series B funding of $48 million from six investors. Late stage venture (Series C) funding in the ammount of $75 million was secured by the company on March 9, 2022.

## Business Activities

The specific financial problem that Branch is attempting to solve is that of financial stability and control for hourly workers. The hourly worker was the initial intended customer. However, Siddiqi learned that the true customer is the employer. Independent contractors (a.k.a "gig workers" or "freelancers") comprise a significant sector of the American labor force (3) and nearly 80% of workers live paycheck to paycheck (4). If an employer refuses to advance wages, workers are faced with the option of high interest payday loans, a situation that often snowballs. Financial stability can be aided by instant payment of wages and fee-less financial services (4). Additionally, instant payment aleviates disenfranchisement of workers who have poor credit or who are "credit invisible" and cannot use traditional financial products. Since the COVID-19 pandemic more employees demand immediate access to earned wages. The immediacy, as well as the concept, of Earned Wage Access (also known as "on demand pay") has been a difficult problem for employers using the traditional paper-based, two-week payroll cycle (4,5). However, these types of transactions can reduce employer costs through issuance of "Pay Cards" rather than the traditional paper payroll. An additional benefit for employers is that instant pay systems can promote employee retention and maintain a healthy pool of consumers (6).

## Technologies 
1. Digital account openning systems (DAO). 
2. Application programming interfaces (API).
3. Person to Person (P2P) and bank to bank (B2B) payment applications.
4. Cloud computing
5. Artificial Intelligence (AI)


## Business Landscape and Results

With an annual revenue of $4 million, Branch is by no means a heavy hitter in the workforce payment field. Branch is most competitive in the market of payment to independent contractors ([1099 workers](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/1099-job-10771.html)). Chief competitors include [PayActiv](https://www.payactiv.com/) ($32.5 million annual revenue), [Gig Wage](https://gigwage.com/) (< $1 million annual revenue)), and [FlexWage](https://flexwage.com/) ($10 million annual revenue) (7). PayActive is considered to be Branch's major competitor, especially in the arena of W-2 workers ([employees](https://squareup.com/us/en/townsquare/1099-vs-w2-which-do-you-want)) (6). The concept of Earned Wage Access originated with PayActiv and the company holds large contracts ([WalMart](https://www.payactiv.com/financial-wellness-service-walmart/) and [New York City Cabs](https://www.payactiv.com/case-studies/payactiv-helps-nyc-cab-drivers-get-paid/) to name a couple). PayActive is also fluidly integrated with the popular human capital management and payroll software, ADP, making them attractive to employers. For the worker, Branch's utility for viewing available shifts and issuance of debit cards are highly desired components that maintain an edge for the company. For the employer, Branch offers simplicity and low fees.

## Recommendations
Branch's major innovations are the fee-less push of wages to employee accounts, creation of a digital wallet linked to a debit card, cashless tips, and mileage reimbursements. Although Branch was able to be an early innovator, competing workforce payment companies have quickly adopted the same products. To remain competitve, Branch will likely need to shift further in the direction of employer-based financial services. Financial services could include alternative credit scoring (especially important in the case of migrant and immigrant workers), 401k, loans, and banking to cover sick leave or child care. Products that are usually hard for hourly workers to obtain but that could be backed by employment record if not by employer. Finding solutions to these types of products in a manner that does not put the customers in a financial bind would maintain Branch's brand of worker-facing products while providing companies with products that attract and retain workers.
